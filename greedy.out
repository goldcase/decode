honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ?
a selection committee was achievement .
yesterday I attended on the first of the committee meeting .
and I expected the committee admits that he has too know what to do with the Senate independent .
what will not strike so for the time .
the members of the selection committee can show some impact .
on the business that strikes a senator over the next two years .
it is an important committee , because , in principle , these nine senators to determine what sit committee some senators .
my is presented to the sitting of the committee to yesterday to realize that one of the nine not attend senators .
it was sent a replacement .
honourable senators , I will name person .
you can see you to how I am kind ' t it ?
the senators will have their own research to find that had been fault .
when an individual accepts an the work , it should do .
the women who sit in the Senate have proven .
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate .
i remember as the sessions held that the committee to the in February of veterans 1998 .
the Senate Ni or the House of Commons do here at that time .
three senators they sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of women .
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to the committee .
i could cite , word by word , what the hon. senator Carstairs took responded to the question I asked .
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? "
it has said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report .
that it had on the parliamentary associations drafted in 1993 .
at that time shall delegations formées were only of men .
in this regard I was , this is replaced by Senator Finestone for a number of years .
however , I look back the opportunity to my association still preferred .
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be decision about these two reports .
every time that the senators on television are verdict .
wondered or by a group of students , to journalists or other .
say that we do ?
it is true , and I will believe .
however , it should be bring in fact .
i do not think in the alternative .
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he or it should participate in all the meetings intended .
we are not the members which we say in the corridors :
" Présentez do you to committee and today , after two years of education , there is a question in committee final '' .
they do not even know what they are viewed , but they stand out when their leaders sang to them .
no they do not know what has happened .
honourable senators , " and " the words " continuité dedication " is the way in our speech .
in the next two weeks , starting to reflect on the way we will deal with the situation of senators independent .
if we do the are not , I créerai my own committee as parliamentarians who are concerned about the world affairs .
we are no one can gained .
his Honour the Speaker :
if any other hon. Senator wishes to speak , you do , is it the pleasure honourable senators , to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
in agreement .
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
